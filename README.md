hello my dear friends. I had to create a python file like this because it was needed in one of my projects.

Let me briefly explain the working logic of the code and what it does. I constantly get output to 1.txt and 2.txt files from my main project. I regularly save the output as data1, data2,......
By calling this code every 2-3 hours, if the first element of the lines in the 1.txt file matches any of the first elements in the lines of 2.txt, I delete that element in 1.txt.

If you have any questions or requests, never hesitate to write...
